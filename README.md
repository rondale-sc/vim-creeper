Personal vim configuration.


# An Adventure

I plan on using Vim for all my text editing needs for as long as it takes to become competent in it.  I avoided using Janus because I think it would limit my ability to learn how to configure vim on my own.

I've had a good amount of experience with Vi before this, but I've never used it as my primary editor.

Here is the deal:

- No arrows
- No plugins that I haven't installed myself and at least somewhat understand
- ~/.vimrc will contain comments and be kept up to date
- plugins will be manually updated
